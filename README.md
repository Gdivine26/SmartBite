## **What It Does**
Have you ever walked into a grocery store and seen shelves full of food about to expire? Or struggled to find affordable, healthy meals in a food desert? **SmartBite** is here to solve these challenges!  

SmartBite is an **AI-powered food waste reduction platform** that helps grocery stores **optimize inventory**, reduces waste, and provides consumers with **discounted food options** along with personalized **meal recommendations**.  

- **For consumers:** Get notified in real-time about discounted food near you and receive AI-generated recipes based on what’s available.  
- **For retailers:** Automatically apply discounts to near-expiry products, reducing waste and increasing sales.  
- **For the community:** Improve access to fresh food in underserved areas while tackling America’s **80 billion pounds of annual food waste**.

## **Inspiration**
Food waste and food insecurity are two sides of the same problem. While **23.5 million people in the U.S. live in food deserts**, grocery stores discard **millions of pounds of unsold food** every year.  

Our team saw an opportunity to **bridge this gap** by using AI and automation to **redirect surplus food to people who need it most**.  

SmartBite isn’t just about saving money—it’s about **solving a real-world problem with technology**.
