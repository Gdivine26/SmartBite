## **What It Does**
Have you ever walked into a grocery store and seen shelves full of food about to expire? Or struggled to find affordable, healthy meals in a food desert? **SmartBite** is here to solve these challenges!  

SmartBite is an **AI-powered food waste reduction platform** that helps grocery stores **optimize inventory**, reduces waste, and provides consumers with **discounted food options** along with personalized **meal recommendations**.  

- **For consumers:** Get notified in real-time about discounted food near you and receive AI-generated recipes based on what’s available.  
- **For retailers:** Automatically apply discounts to near-expiry products, reducing waste and increasing sales.  
- **For the community:** Improve access to fresh food in underserved areas while tackling America’s **80 billion pounds of annual food waste**.

## **Inspiration**
Food waste and food insecurity are two sides of the same problem. While 23.5 million people in the U.S. live in food deserts, grocery stores discard millions of pounds of unsold food every year. This disconnect is extremely concerning and we felt that this wasted food could be put to use.

Our team saw an opportunity to bridge this gap as well as help our communities by using AI and automation to redirect surplus food to people who need it most.  

SmartBite isn’t just about saving money—it’s about solving a pressing real-world problem with technology.
